Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to understand how to display different shapes, texts, lines, and images onto a canvas on an HTML5 page. 
 
Known Issues:
Inserting the image onto the page successfully was a challenge at first but I was able to figure it out after tampering with it for a while.

function draw_rectangle() { // this function called the draw_function draws a rectangle on the canvas with the context 2d. The values 130, 90, 50, and 75 in the context.fillRect() set the dimensions of the rectangle and will also place where the corner of the rectangle will be drawn on the canvas
	var canvas = document.getElementById("x");
	var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
	context.fillRect(130, 50, 50, 75); }
	
function write_text() { // this function called write_text will add text to the canvas with the ID x once again from the previous rectangle. I added the context and fill text with ("DIY Diagnostics", 10, 20) which gives the x and y coordinates for where the text is going too be printed and the text being printed is "DIY Diagnostics." The 13px and Verdana also gives the font and the size of the text that's being printed.
	var canvas_two = document.getElementById("x");
	var context_two = canvas_two.getContext("2d");
	context_two.font = "13px Verdana"; 
	context_two.fillText("DIY Diagnostics", 10, 20); } 

function draw_image() { // this function called draw_image will draw the image from the link I inserted under the smiley face at the given coordinates. This image will be drawn at 200 x 200 because the original dimensions make it a square.
	var canvas_three = document.getElementById("x");
	var context_three = canvas_three.getContext("2d");
