/* This function I added above is the draw_function which will draw a rectangle on the canvas. THe values (180, 90, 50, and 75) will be used to set the dimensions of the rectangle and will also place the corner of the rectangle for where it's going to be drawn on the canvas.
This function above called write_text will add text to the canvas with the ID x once again from the previous rectangle. I added the context and fill text with ("DIY Diagnostics", 10, 20) which gives the x and y coordinates for where the text is going too be printed and the text being printed is "DIY Diagnostics." The 13px and Verdana also gives the font and the size of the text that's being printed.
The function above draw_image will draw the image from the link I insterted under smiley face at the given coordinates. This image will be drawn at 200 x 200 because the original dimensions make it a square.
